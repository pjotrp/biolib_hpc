BioLib/HPC-gff3lib: The fastest Big Data GFF3 parser. 

GFF3 records are iterated for their features, without loading all data
into memory. Bindings will be available for Perl, Python and Ruby.

One optimization trick is to parse GFF3 'optimistically' by blocks.
Most GFF3 files are organized into blocks of genome sections and
contigs.  Cross referencing is normally within those blocks, so
loading block by block in memory allows fast resolving. Less organized
files, meaning lots of distant cross-referencing, may benefit from
further caching, which may be implemented later.

Note: this module was started at the pre-BOSC code fest Vienna July
2011, following up on the recent Ruby and Python GFF3 parsers. It is
under development and not released.
