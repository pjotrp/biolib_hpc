BioLib/HPC-gff3lib: The fastest Big Data GFF3 parser. 

GFF3 records are iterated for their features, without loading all data
into memory. Bindings are available for Perl, Python and Ruby.

One optimization trick it to parse GFF3 optimistically by blocks. Most
GFF3 files are organized into blocks of genome sections and contigs.
Cross referencing is within those blocks, so loading block by block in
memory allows fast resolving. Less organized files, meaning lots of
distant cross-referencing, may benefit from further caching, which may
be implemented later.
